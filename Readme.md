## Introduction
In model society, people would visit lots of place. As a result, the importance of map is higher and higher. For traditional map, people would only see spots on a pseudo plane. However, thanks to AR, the map could be much more closer to the real world. We have surveyed lots of AR map app. There are some flawness of the app.

### Flawness of current AR map
- an app per event
- time cost for user to generate map

### Aradar's solution
In Aradar, there is a friendly web interface for users to upload their spots and descriptions. After that, users would get a 4 char room key and they could share for others to get the customize map. After the app user key in the key, the spots would be load and show in the app!
